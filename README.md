## Project Workflow  

### Part 1: Enhanced Data Lake Components  
1. **Data Ingestion:**  
   - Researched batch, micro-batch, and real-time ingestion methods.  
   - Compared tools like Apache Kafka and Hortonworks DataFlow for scalability and performance.  

2. **Data Organization:**  
   - Explored directory structures, version control, and database systems.  
   - Implemented a sample directory structure for organizing datasets.  

3. **Data Security and Governance:**  
   - Identified tools like OKTA for access management and Proofpoint for email security.  
   - Developed a basic security policy addressing common concerns.  

4. **Indexing and Search:**  
   - Researched federated search and tools like Elasticsearch.  
   - Created a prototype federated search system for multiple data sources.  

5. **Analytics:**  
   - Compared techniques for analyzing structured and unstructured data.  
   - Performed a basic analysis using Apache Mahout with visual presentations.  

6. **Visualization:**  
   - Explored tools like PowerBI, SAS Visual Analytics, and D3.JS.  
   - Built a visualization dashboard to present data insights effectively.  

### Part 2: Advanced Data Lake Architecture  
1. Designed an architecture diagram integrating all components from Part 1.  
2. Proposed strategies for evolving the architecture with emerging technologies.  
3. Explored the use of Generative AI to enhance indexing, search, and analytics capabilities.
